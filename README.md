# Binary Trees

Binary trees are a fundamental data structure in computer science and are used to represent hierarchical relationships. A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. Here are some key points about binary trees:

- **Nodes**: Each node in a binary tree contains a piece of data, often called the "value" or "key". The structure of a node includes pointers or references to its left and right children (or null if no child exists).
  
- **Root**: The topmost node of a binary tree is called the root node. It's the starting point for accessing the tree's elements.
  
- **Parent, Child, Sibling**: Nodes in a binary tree are organized hierarchically. A node that points to another node is called the parent node, and the node being pointed to is called its child node. Nodes that share the same parent are called siblings.
  
- **Leaf Nodes**: Nodes that do not have any children are called leaf nodes or terminal nodes. They are at the bottom of the tree.
  
- **Height**: The height of a binary tree is the length of the longest path from the root node to a leaf node. It represents the depth of the tree.

Binary trees have various applications in computer science, including:

- Binary search trees (BSTs) for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.
- Expression trees for representing mathematical expressions.
- Huffman trees for data compression.
- Decision trees for machine learning and decision-making algorithms.
